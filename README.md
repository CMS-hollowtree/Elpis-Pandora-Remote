This uses TwitterBootstrap for CSS and formatting.

The HTML looks best in Firefox.  - Didn't spend too much time trying to make it presentable in IE.

To get started:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  Modify app/views.py to reflect your Elpis server's IP address or hostname.    Line:8 hostip = 'x.x.x.x'
